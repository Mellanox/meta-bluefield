We want to include more fonts than are available in the
xorg-minimal-fonts package.  The missing fonts are in the
font-misc-misc package.  The problem is, those 2 packages
conflict.  This modified recipe tries to resolve those
conflicts by eliminating the overlapping fonts.

Note that excluding the xorg-minimal-fonts recipe causes
all sorts of dependency issues we would rather not deal
with.
